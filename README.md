###### I am a data scientist with a background in banking and improving customer experiences. I received my Bachelors from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, in Economics and Statistics. Further more I completed a rigorous 3 month bootcamp with BrainStation focusing on Data Science. While at my bootcamp, I have experienced cleaning, visualizing, organizing, and modelling data. 

###### Primarily I have skills in Python, SQL, and Tableau. On a daily basis I strive to further improve my Data Science experience. My goal is to make data as approachable as possible, breaking down complex structures and problems presenting them to solve any problems. 

### Data Tools

* **Data Collection and Storage:** SQL, MySQL 

* **Data Processing and Analytics:** Python, and Jupyter

* **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, Power BI, and Tableau

* **Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clusterization, Time Series and Neural Network

### Data Science Project

* Predicting Real Estate Sales Price
  * Houses are crazy expensive in Canada. I wanted to find a way to predict how much a house would sell for. This would make finding locations, spending time only on houses where it may be within your budget and narrowing locations. This would help both buyers and sellers to optimize valuation of the home. I used three main models, XG boosting, gradient boosting as well as a linear regression.
